Tips on How to Work with JinXML
===============================

Picturing JinXML as a Tree of Objects
-------------------------------------
In the introduction we had the following example converted from JSON. It's a very light-touch conversion as a number of bad JSON habits are still present e.g. using selectors to implicitly determine the type of object. But it is a good example to visualise:

```xml
	<markers> 
	    <marker>
	        /* When a field has multiple values it's natural to use parentheses */
	        name:       "Rixos The Palm Dubai",
	        location:   [ 25.1212, 55.1535 ]
	    </marker>
	    <marker>
	        // Commas can be omitted or swapped for semi-colons. 
	        name:       'Shangri-La Hotel';
	        location:   [ 25.2084 55.2719 ]
	    </marker>
	    <marker>
	        <!-- Trailing commas are allowed. Also single-quotes, as in HTML. -->
	        name:       "Grand Hyatt";
	        location:   [ 25.2285, 55.3273, ]
	    </marker>
	</markers>
```

The following picture illustrates how JinXML encourages you to think about data as a tree of objects. The element name (in bold) tells you the type of the object and the attributes give details. The links between objects are mostly anonymous (actually the empty-string) but some are labelled e.g. `name` and `location`. Links that share the same parent and the same name are considered to be ordered (shown left-to-right).

Every JinXML expression can be visualised like this. Even JSON objects and literals naturally fit into this model. That is no coincidence but one of the central goals of JinXML - to provide a unified internal model for JSON and (minimal) XML. 

How To Recursively Edit an Element
----------------------------------
We often want to process a tree in place, searching for things we want to change and modifying them. To illustrate how to do this, here's an example that replaces all instances of "http:// with "https://" in a modifiable tree using the Java API.


	void replaceHttpWithHttps( Element element ) {
		if ( element.isStringValue() ) {
			element.setStringValue( element.getStringValue().replace( "http://", "https://" ) );
		}
		for ( Member m : element.members() ) {
			replaceHttpWithHttps( m.getChild() );
		}
	}


How to Recursively Transform an Element into a new Element
----------------------------------------------------------
Just as often we do not want to edit a tree but to create a new tree using a systematic transformation. We could adapt the above code simply by using explicit copying:

```java
Element transformHttpIntoHttps( Element element ) {
	return element.deepMutableCopy().replaceHttpWithHttps();
}
```

Or we can try to write it in a more functional style by constructing a new tree bottom-up. Because elements can be quite complex, we do this with a builder.

```java
Element transformHttpIntoHttps( Element element ) {
	if ( element.isStringValue() ) {
		return Element.newStringValue( element.getStringValue().replace( "http://", "https://" ) );
	} else {
		Builder builder = Element.newBuilder( element.getName(), element.attributes() );
		for ( Member m : element.members() ) {
			String selector = m.getSelector();
			Element child = m.getChild();
			builder.include( selector, transformHttpIntoHttps( child ) );
		}
		return builder.newElement();
	}
}
```

Alternatively we could use mapChildren to write this quite neatly with lambdas:

```java
Element easyTransform( Element element ) {
	if ( element.isStringValue() ) {
		return Element.newStringValue( element.getStringValue().replace( "http://", "https://" ) );
	} else {
		return element.mapChildren( e -> easyTransform( e ) );	
	}
}
```
